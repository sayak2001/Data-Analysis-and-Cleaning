# Data-Analysis-and-Cleaning
A set of stock market datasets has been downloaded and SQL operations has been performed with cleaning to find the 20-day moving average 
and 50 -day moving average, which helps the action to be performed like to hold, to buy or to sell the stock.
Some analysis is also made like which company stock to buy and to sell with proper justification.
apart from this many things have been discovered and itâ€™s a great project for a beginner to start their hands on for getting an idea of 
stock market and data science.
